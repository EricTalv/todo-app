## Description 

Make a todo app in vanilla JS and add theme switching capibilites.


## Other Features

I plan to experiment with animating small interactions
to make the app more smooth. 

## Project status

The project is basically finished, I also plan 
to add more css themes in the future.

## Other notes

I made this app without any courses or tutorials, just my knowledge,
googling, trial and error, just to test my vanilla.js skills and have some 
fun while at it :)
